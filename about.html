      <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        GT Mall is an online marketplace focused on smartwatches and wearables. 
        Our mission is to bring the latest tech to everyone at genuine prices 
        with a clean and simple shopping experience.

            <h4>Our Story</h4>
            <p>
              GT Mall started with a simple idea – online shopping should be 
              fast, transparent and trustworthy. Instead of listing thousands of 
              random products, we carefully handpick a smaller set of watches and 
              wearables so that you don’t have to waste time comparing everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every feature we build is focused on the customer: secure checkout, 
              easy order tracking, and responsive support. Over time, we plan to 
              expand into more lifestyle categories while keeping the same focus on quality.

            <h4>Future roadmap</h4>
            <p>
              We are actively working on a dedicated seller panel, more detailed
              order tracking, and additional payment options (such as Cashfree)
              once the website is fully approved for production payments.
